make new tiles (tv, bed, papers on the ground?)
make a level selectable screen (for editor mode at least)
make fire drawable on the editor
make events per map





--------------------------------------------------------
make hidden doors
make a character.data so that we can load different maps
make an Item superclass
make a history log
make the actions system cleaner lol
add items
add slashing water
make puddles like Fire, aka they're objects






dirtiest thing: each square has an X and a Y, but their X and Y could differ from their game.grid[Y][X]
ideally the square class doesnt have any Y X

doom: change the behavior so he doesnt get baited by a random door open
